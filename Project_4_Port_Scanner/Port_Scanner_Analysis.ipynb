    "# Project 4: Port Scanner Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "In network security, open or vulnerable ports on servers and devices represent significant entry points for malicious actors. \n",
    "Understanding which ports are open and what services they are running is a fundamental step in assessing a \n",
    "system's security posture and identifying potential weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "To develop a command-line based port scanner in Python capable of identifying open ports on a given IP address or hostname. \n",
    "This tool will serve as a basic utility for network reconnaissance and initial vulnerability assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Technologies Utilized:\n",
    "* **Python:** The core programming language.\n",
    "* **`socket` module:** Python's low-level networking interface, used to establish connections to target ports.\n",
    "* **`threading` module:** Employed to implement concurrency, allowing the scanner to check multiple ports simultaneously, \n",
    "     thereby significantly improving performance.\n",
    "* **`sys` and `optparse` (or `argparse`) modules:** For handling command-line arguments to make the script user-friendly and configurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expected Outcome:\n",
    "A robust and efficient Python script that, when executed from the command line, takes a target IP/hostname and a range of ports as input, \n",
    "and then outputs a clear list of all detected open ports. \n",
    "This will aid in understanding accessible network services."
