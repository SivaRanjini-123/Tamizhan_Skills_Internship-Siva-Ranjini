    "# Project 6: Secure Chat App\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "In an era where digital communication is paramount, the privacy and security of messages are often compromised due to the lack of default end-to-end encryption in many mainstream chat applications. This vulnerability exposes sensitive information to potential eavesdropping and interception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a rudimentary secure messaging application that facilitates encrypted text communication between two users. This application will serve as a proof-of-concept for secure data exchange over a network, emphasizing the implementation of cryptographic principles for privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Technologies Utilized:\n",
    "* **Python:** The core programming language for the application logic and network communication.\n",
    "* **Socket Programming (`socket` module):** Essential for establishing network connections and handling data transmission between the chat participants (client and server).\n",
    "* **PyCryptodome (`Crypto.PublicKey.RSA`, `Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP`):** This robust cryptographic library will be used to implement RSA asymmetric encryption. This allows for secure key exchange and subsequent message encryption/decryption, ensuring end-to-end security.\n",
    "* **Threading (`threading` module):** To handle simultaneous sending and receiving of messages without blocking the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expected Outcome:\n",
    "A basic yet functional command-line based chat tool capable of providing end-to-end encrypted text communication. This tool will demonstrate the core principles of secure messaging and is suitable for educational purposes and internal demonstrations of secure communication protocols."

    "# Conclusion - Project 6: Secure Chat App\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully developed a basic secure chat application leveraging Python's socket programming for network communication and the `PyCryptodome` library for RSA-based end-to-end encryption. By implementing separate server and client components, and integrating key generation, exchange, and message encryption/decryption, the application effectively demonstrates the fundamental principles of secure communication. This hands-on experience provides valuable insight into the importance of cryptography in safeguarding digital interactions and serves as an educational foundation for understanding more complex secure messaging systems."
