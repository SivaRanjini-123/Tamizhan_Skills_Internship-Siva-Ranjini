    "# Project 3: Keylogger Implementation (For Educational Purposes Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "Understanding how keyloggers work is crucial for developing robust cybersecurity measures. By creating a basic keylogger, we can gain insights into how malicious software might capture keystrokes, which in turn helps in designing better detection and prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to implement a simple keylogger using Python. This tool is developed purely for **ethical and educational demonstration purposes** to understand the underlying mechanisms. It is **strictly not intended for any illicit or harmful activities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requirements:\n",
    "* **Python:** The core programming language.\n",
    "* **`pynput` library:** A cross-platform library to control and monitor input devices.\n",
    "* **File System Access:** To write the captured keystrokes to a log file.\n",
    "* **Ethical Disclaimer:** Emphasize the educational nature and discourage misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expected Outcome:\n",
    "A functional Python script that can capture and log keystrokes to a designated file. The output will demonstrate how such a tool operates, fostering a deeper understanding of input monitoring and its associated security implications."
