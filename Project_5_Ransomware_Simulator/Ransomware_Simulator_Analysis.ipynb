    "# Project 5: Simple Ransomware Simulator (Educational Use Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "Ransomware has emerged as a pervasive and devastating cybersecurity threat, fundamentally impacting individuals and organizations by encrypting critical data and demanding payment for its release. Understanding the technical mechanisms behind ransomware is crucial for developing effective defensive strategies and fostering cybersecurity awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "This project aims to build a simplified ransomware simulator. The core objective is to demonstrate the process of file encryption and subsequent decryption using a cryptographic key. This simulation is designed purely for **ethical, educational, and demonstrative purposes** to illustrate how such malicious software operates, without causing actual harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Technologies Utilized:\n",
    "* **Python:** The foundational programming language for the simulator.\n",
    "* **`cryptography` module (specifically `Fernet`):** A robust and secure cryptographic library in Python, providing symmetric encryption (the same key for encryption and decryption).\n",
    "* **`os` module:** For interacting with the operating system, particularly for navigating file directories and manipulating file paths.\n",
    "* **`tkinter` (Optional for GUI):** While the core will be CLI-based, `tkinter.messagebox` can be used for disclaimers or simple prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expected Outcome:\n",
    "A Python script that can:\n",
    "1.  Generate a unique encryption key.\n",
    "2.  Encrypt all files within a specified target folder (e.g., `test_files/`) using this key.\n",
    "3.  Append a custom extension (e.g., `.encrypted`) to the encrypted files.\n",
    "4.  Decrypt the encrypted files using the correct key, restoring them to their original state and removing the custom extension.\n",
    "5.  Include clear disclaimers about the ethical use of the tool."

By demonstrating the processes of key generation, file encryption, and subsequent decryption, the project provides a practical insight into the fundamental mechanisms employed by real-world ransomware. The emphasis on using dummy files and a clear ethical disclaimer highlights the critical importance of responsible and educational use of such powerful tools. This simulation serves as an effective educational demo, fostering greater awareness of cybersecurity threats and the significance of strong data protection measures."
